# HANGMAN GAME

# Description
This is a simple Hangman game written in Python. The game is played through the terminal and has no graphical interface. 
The goal of the game is to guess a secret word, one letter at a time, before running out of guess lives. 
The game does not include the drawing of the man being hanged. Instead, the word with the letters appearing as more and more 
letters are guessed correctly.

# Installation
To run the game, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. 
You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Once you have installed Python, clone the repository to your local machine:

`$ git clone https://github.com/SaidKardic/hangman.git`

# Usage
To play the game, open the terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

`$ python3 main.py`

The game will start, and you will be prompted to enter your first letter guess. 
Enter one letter at a time, and press enter to submit your guess. If the letter is in the word to find, 
it will be revealed in the correct position(s). If it is not in the word, you will lose one of your remaining guess lives.
You can continue guessing letters until you have correctly guessed the entire word or until you run out of lives.
